# DEMO AUGMENTED REALITY

This is a demo project that uses [AR.js](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js) for augmented reality.


## How to run it

```
npm install
```
```
npm start
```

The app runs on port 3000 over SSL (https://localhost:3000)

## How it works

The app uses the webcam on desktop or the phone camera to scan the image HIRO.jpg -> this is the marker that AR.js uses to display a 3D scene. This demo displays a #D blue box over the marker
